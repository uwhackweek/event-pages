# Hackweek event page

This repository stores html rendered in Notion associated with our static website hackweek flier/advertisements. We do this because the Notion-generated URLs are cryptic and we want to have an easy-to-remember URL for our events pages. 

Content here should be continually updated as the application process evolves (i.e. from OT to participant applications, etc).

## Steps for updating

1. Navigate to the Notion page containing the web content
2. Click on the 3 dots in the upper right
3. Choose "Export"
4. Select "HTML", "Current view", "Everything" (all defaults)
5. This generates a .zip folder. Extract all the files on your local computer
6. There will be a folder and a file. Rename the file "index.html"
7. Delete the existing folder on GitHub
8. Upload/push the index.html and new folder to GitHub
